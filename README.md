# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The project utilizes a dataset containing clinical parameters of patients, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant features.Few machine learning models are trained on this dataset to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals.

**Data**
The Data directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model. The dataset file is named "heart_disease.csv"
